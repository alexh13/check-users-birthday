# check-users-birthday
Short beginner program made that asks user for their birthday and returns a message if conditions are met.

What I learned:
- Use a C++ IDE that has been installed on my computer
- Write code that utilizes fundamental C++ concepts such as the iostream library, a main function, 
  variables, expressions, input, output, and decision structures.
